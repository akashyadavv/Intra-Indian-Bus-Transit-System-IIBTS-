# Bus Reservation System
 A Bus Reservation database System has been implemented here. The functions of this database system are to maintain records of the various transactions that happen, from the booking of ticket to the departure of the passenger. The various entities used are Bus station, Bus, Bus company, Seat, Passenger details, the fare of the trip and the User details.

The design of the database was done using an ER model. A schema and an EER diagram have been depicted for a better understanding. Various relations and tables have been shown and how each of them are related. The cardinality of these relationships is also given. The tables were made using the DDL commands.

Triggers were used to counter certain constraints like the base fare being updated incorrectly or checking if the tax to be collected is entered correctly. Audit â€“ triggers were also displayed.
Queries were used to display the details of the passengers and the fare prices. They were also used to display common values in two tables that matched a certain condition.

This database is capable of automating all the basic processes of a reservation system. The Intra Indian Bus Transit System (IIBTS) created is capable of managing large transactions thus improving the current scenario where manual transactions are done. It has its limitations but is a good approach to automating the reservation system.
